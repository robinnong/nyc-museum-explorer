# NYC Museum Explorer
My second project using JQuery and an API for the Fall 2019 Javascript course at Juno College. 

The project pulls data from <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/fn6f-htvy">New York City Open Data's Museums dataset (JSON)</a>, which lists all museums in New York. Use the web application to search and filter through results to find museum names, addresses, websites and contact information.
