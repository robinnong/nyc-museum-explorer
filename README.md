# NYC Museum Explorer
My second project using JQuery and an API for the Fall 2019 Javascript course at Juno College. 

The project pulls data from <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/fn6f-htvy">New York City Open Data's Museums dataset (JSON)</a>, which lists all museums in New York. Use the web application to search and filter through results to find museum names, addresses, websites and contact information. 

Project features: 
- Fetching RESTful API data, sorting, and displaying it in a presentable way
- Demonstrated understanding of array methods to assign each museum type as a colour and icon
- Use of the Animate on Scroll library to fade in list results
- Creating a unique Google Maps search query for each museum and displaying it as a link
- User can input a search query to the search bar
