The project pulls data from <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/fn6f-htvy">New York City Open Data's Museums dataset (JSON)</a>, which contains information about all museums in New York. Use the web application to search and filter through results to find museum names, addresses, websites and contact information. 

Second project using JQuery and an API for the Fall 2019 Javascript course at Juno College.
